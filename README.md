# TJ-56-619-Recycle
Recycling the TJ-56-619 kit from Aliexpress.


The kit itself uses the "Qweather" API, a Chinese weather service that isn't reliable enough. 
Users have reported problems registering and using the service.

This repo stores the Arduino sketch that worked for me to get the approximately same functionality.

# TJ-56-619-Recycle
Recycling the TJ-56-619 kit from Aliexpress.

The kit itself uses the "Qweather" API, a Chinese weather service that isn't reliable enough. 
Users have reported problems registering and using the service.

This repo stores the Arduino sketch that worked for me to get the approximately same functionality.

The only things you need to edit to your personal use case are :

    Your WiFi's SSID (In my experience the ESP01 needs a 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi)

    Your WiFi's Password 

    Your OpenWeatherMap API Key

    Your City

    Your Country Code in 2 letter format. (Simply Google "2 letter country codes")

    Your Offset from GMT in seconds
